# ember-node-botchat

This application was built based on this online tutorial written by Pusher https://pusher.com/tutorials/chat-bot-emberjs-dialogflow

It is a chat bot application built with Node.js and Ember.js using Diaglogflow agent https://dialogflow.com/.  For more info on agents: https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/agents-overview.

Pusher's API will be used in this application to update the client (in this case Ember.js). In order to get responses in realtime, weâ€™ll use Pusher to update the client, this amongst other things, will enhance the flow of conversation (see tutorial https://pusher.com/tutorials/chat-bot-emberjs-dialogflow for more information).
